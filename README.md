# Real time web 22/23

## Description

Real Time Web is a course from the minor Web Design & Development. During this course I'll learn all about the real time web and learn to create a live connection between the client, server and other users. I'll be able to send data real time both ways and at the same time.

## Goals / Learning objectives

There are a few goals I have to achieve during this course:

- Deal with real time complexity
- Handle real time client-server interaction
- Handle real time data management
- Handle multi user support
 
Additionally, there are a couple of things I wish to learn as well:

- Move characters(DOM elements) through a space in real time
- Pull accurate data from the NS API
- Animate characters and give them skins using Rive

## Introductory assignment

To kick this course off we were assigned to create a simple chat app so we could experiment using socket.io. While the assignment was generally meant to be executed in teams, I decided to work on this assignment on my own. I decided to remake a demo of Whatsapp on the web. 
I created a room which clients could enter and fill in their name and chat with each other. Making this assignment helped me get an understanding of real time web and the use of socket.io to implement web sockets. I used this code as a base for my next assignment.
